Android Dice Game.

This was a college project for my Android app development class.  I have included the Java files.  It is one player, playing against the computer using hardcoded rules for the computer's "brain."  When you win, there is a mini game where the dice turn into spaceships and you have to shoot them in a certain number of shots in Atari fashion.
